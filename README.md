# Form-Response-Emailer
The "Mailing System" script automates sending emails to respondents based on form submissions in a Google Sheets document. It retrieves data from the active sheet, iterating through each row starting from the second (to skip headers). When triggered by a form submission event (`e`), it retrieves a specific draft email with the subject "Start living your AIESEC experience ✈️" from Gmail drafts. For each new response, if an email address exists and a draft email is found, it sends an HTML email using `MailApp.sendEmail()` to the respondent's email address listed in the sheet, using the draft's subject and body. This setup efficiently manages email communication with form respondents within the AIESEC context.
